                <article>
                    <p>President Obama and President Trump were different leaders of the same powerful nation.</p>
                    <p>In his innovative use of social media, Obama earned the title of the first social media president, but during his time in office, Trump surely earned the title of the social media president, preceded by the likes of President Kennedy (the TV president) and President Roosevelt (frequently broadcasted via radio).</p>
                    <!-- <p>Throughout history, the ways in which the American public learned about their  -->
                    <p>Newspaper publications, radio broadcasts and television programmes were some of the ways in which the American public accessed the messages shared by their chief of state.</p>
                    <p>It is also through these messages that the people learn who their president is - are they down to earth, do they take national security seriously, what is their stance on hot button issues and perhaps, if they like mustard on their hot dogs?</p>
                    <p>In social media, powerful leaders, particularly in politics have found a new platform to keep the people up to date at all hours of the day.</p>
                    <p></p>


                    <p>Political correctness begins with a belief in using inclusive language—words and phrases that
                        have not historically been used to demean, belittle, or insult any particular group of people.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although it is a term that has been around for centuries, Political Correctness has grown to be a
                        hot button topic. This is particularly true in the United States, arguably the most powerful
                        nation in the world which continues to grow both demographically and economically. </p>
                    <p>Political correctness has also been exacerbated, social media platforms like Twitter, have become
                        a breeding ground for criticisms and exchanged words against political correctness. </p>
                    <p>So the purpose of political correctness is to unite, rather than to divide.</p>
                    <p>Heres how the views of two of America’s most polarising presidents put them on the side of
                        Unifier and Divider in the political correctness debate.</p>
                    <p>The good news is, neither is a fence sitter.</p>

                    <p>Both agree that as a whole, political correctness has been taken too far. Obama recognises that a
                        means to unify has become a tool to divide, whereas Trump believes political correctness belies
                        the first amendment’s phrase on Freedom of Speech.</p>
