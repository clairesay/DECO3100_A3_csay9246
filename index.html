                    <h4>What the tweets of America's most iconic presidents tell us about their leadership</h4>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <p>Throughout history, the mediums by which American presidents addressed their nation continued to change over time.</p>
                    <p>Newspaper publications, radio broadcasts and television programmes were some of the ways that national messages were communicated over space and time.</p>
                    <p>In social media, powerful leaders, particularly in politics have found a new platform to keep the people up to date with their policies and at all hours of the day.</p>
                    <p>In his innovative use of social media, Obama earned the title of the first social media president, but during his time in office, Trump surely earned the title of the social media president.</p>
                    <!-- WHAT DID TRUMP TWEET VS WHAT DID OBAMA TWEET -->
                    <p>Despite their similarities in using social media, both could not be any more different.</p>
                    <p>Born of a white Kansas mother and black African American father, Obama became a symbol of unity when he entered office in 2008. It wasn't just his background, but also 
                        his policies and unifying approach to leading a diversifying nation that drove his identity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, Trump entered the race to the White House as an unpopular contender, largely for his divisive rhetoric wielded against the Hispanic and Muslim communities.
                        Carrying out unpopular policies such as 'Building the Wall' to keep illegal immigrants out and withdrawing from global climate agreements were thought to isolate the US from the world, and the people within it, from each toher. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>How does Twitter come into this? Obama and Trump were the first presidents to utilise social media not only to communicate ongoing policies, but also to comment on happening events.</p>
                    <p>It is a mouthpiece by which people have been able to communicate their thoughts about current events within 140 characters or less.</p>
                         <!-- preceded by the likes of President Kennedy (the TV president) and President Roosevelt (frequently broadcasted via radio).</p> -->
                    <!-- <p>With the advent of social media, presidents have also been able to access social media. </p> -->
                         <!-- the American public accessed the messages shared by their chief of state.</p> -->
                    <!-- <p>It is also through these messages that the people learn who their president is - are they down to earth, do they take national security seriously, what is their stance on hot button issues and perhaps, if they like mustard on their hot dogs?</p> -->
                    <p>This visualisation seeks to explore how their language on the social media platform indicates what kind of leader they are.</p>

                    <h3>What is leadership?</h3>
                                        <!-- <p>President Obama and President Trump were different leaders of the same powerful nation.</p> -->
                    <!-- <p>In their book, a 'Better way to evaluate leadership potential', Cohn and Wiley identify seven key qualities, which research time and time again have demonstrated what makes a good leader.</p> -->
                    <!-- <p>A good leader does not only exemplify the key qualities of a good leader, but are also aware of their weaknesses and strive to constantly improve.</p> -->
                    <p>According to X, there are two effective methods of leadership. We've all heard of Divide and Conquer - former President Trump's policies have been constantly compared to such a method.
                        However, Obama's approach to leadership couldn't be any more different than Trump. With a Unite and Build approach, Obama sought to bring diverse groups together to build a united nation. </p>
                        <p>We can identify this from their language. </p>
                        <!-- The first being 'Unite and Build' -> We can liken this to Obama's method of leadership. On the other hand, Trump's methods and policies have been likened to the term 'Divide and Conquer'. </p> -->

                    <p>Political correctness begins with a belief in using inclusive language—words and phrases that
                        have not historically been used to demean, belittle, or insult any particular group of people.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although it is a term that has been around for centuries, Political Correctness has grown to be a
                        hot button topic. This is particularly true in the United States, arguably the most powerful
                        nation in the world which continues to grow both demographically and economically. </p>
                    <p>Political correctness has also been exacerbated, social media platforms like Twitter, have become
                        a breeding ground for criticisms and exchanged words against political correctness. </p>
                    <p>So the purpose of political correctness is to unite, rather than to divide.</p>
                    <p>Heres how the views of two of America’s most polarising presidents put them on the side of
                        Unifier and Divider in the political correctness debate.</p>
                    <p>The good news is, neither is a fence sitter.</p>
