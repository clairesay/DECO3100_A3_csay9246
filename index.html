                    <p>
                        Barack Hussein Obama II and Donald John Trump were very different leaders of the same nation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Born of a white Kansas woman and black Kenyan man, Obama was raised in humble beginnings and
                        immersed in a ‘multiplicity’ of cultures, having lived in various countries from a very young
                        age. (Nelson, 2021)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, Trump, a son of a New York real estate developer, was
                        raised with rigour. He built an ambitious career that eventually led him to
                        tycoonify his family’s business. (BBC, 2020)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite having walked such divergent paths to the White House, and led their nation in distinct
                        ways, they share the title of 'Social Media president' due in large part to, their presence on
                        Twitter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, Twitter has helped redefine the volumes of American politics, with both presidents
                        using it as mouthpiece
                        to engage with the greater American public.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            If such is the case, does the way in which Obama and Trump present themselves on Twitter
                            accurately reflect their reputations respectively, as the Unifier and Divider?

                    <p>
                        Not all shows of leadership are identical.
                        According to Razzetti (2018), one's approach to leadership demonstrates much about their
                        priorities for the people.

                                by empowering people to achieve something "bigger than themselves in personally

                                As a unifier in the public eye, <mark class="democrat">Obama</mark> was thought to
                                demonstrate selfless devotion towards the greater good,
                                despite being criticised for his stringent reform and commitment to change. (Scotti,
                                2016)

                                    approach.</strong> Through this deception,
                                they spark anger and violence to "break groups into smaller, less powerful ones".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <mark class="republican">Trump</mark> was unpopular for his divisive approach to
                                leadership, blaming foreign influence to bond Americans together in the short term.
                                However, he was remembered for the way he disillusioned and disempowered people. (Smith,
                                2020)

                        These attitudes towards leadership have been defined historically, but continue to be as true
                        today as ever. So why
                        would a leadership stance be so important for a powerhouse nation as the US?

                        In what Frey (2018) calls a ‘diversity explosion’, the US has seen significant growth in mixed
                        ethnicity minorities
                        due to "youthful immigration from Latin America, and Asia" which has been crucial to a shift in
                        the ethnic landscape. (Lee, 2020)

                        The National Equity Atlas (2021) outlines that "diversity - in the context of inclusion - is a
                        driver of
                        innovation, business growth and economic progress."

                    <p> <mark>
                            Thus a president who can bring these
                            differing groups together continues to be more important than ever before, to help cultivate
                            a prosperous future for the country.

                    <p>
                        In light of such a diversity, how did Obama and Trump communicate to appeal to voters, if at
                        all?

                        The way a president aligns with the people starts with their choice of language.
                        President Obama and President Trump utilised social media as a means
                        of extending
                        their nationwide reach and driving engagement - an advantage that presidents who preceded them,
                        simply did not have.

                        Unlike his predecessor who tweeted with 'first person' pronouns just 10% of the time,
                        President Trump tweeted the words 'I' 'me' and 'my' in about a quarter of all his tweets.

                    <h3>On Countries</h3>
                    <p>As presidents of the US, one might assume that both Obama and Trump are focused on addressing
                        internal problems and pursuits.
                        </br></br>
                        The data tells us otherwise, however.
                    </p>
                    <!-- a bar graph here on mentions of 'America' -->
                    <!-- ==  === -->
                    <p><strong>Interestingly, President Obama tweeted about America almost twice as frequently than
                            Trump.</strong></p>
                    <label class="title">'America' and 'Americans': Frequency of usage in tweets</label>
                    <div id="america-mentioned-bar" class="plots"></div>
                    <p>
                        In fact, Obama tweeted about American topics over 10 times as much as he acknowledged his
                        foreign counterparts.
                        However, Trump posted 200 tweets more about international topics than internal affairs.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>From a glance, Trump already appears to have strayed from the internal challenges of his
                            country, while Obama stayed true to his own nation.</strong></p>

                    <p>Mapping out the countries mentioned in their tweets, it shows just how widespread Trump's
                        international perspective was, as opposed to Obama.</p>

                    <p>President Obama's tweets on foreign nations appear to consist of diplomatically necessary
                        exchanges, such as in response to the 2010 Chilean earthquake:
                    </p>
                    <mark class="indented">"The American people send their deepest condolences to the Chilean people.
                        The U.S. is ready to help in any way."</mark>

                    <p>However, on more than one occasion, President Trump has been accused of divisive language against
                        other nations.</p>
                    <mark class="indented">
                        "[Mexico] laughs at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or
                        I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL!"
                    </mark>

                <article>
                    <p>It could be said that President Obama adopted a 'unifier' mindset, perpetuating internal topics
                        and issues, for the benefit of the nation.</p>
                    <p>Completely polar to his predecessor, President Trump demonstrated a 'divider' attitude making
                        personal attacks on foreign nations, not necessarily in the interest of the people as a whole,
                        and thus
                        could be seen as self-serving.

                        Of the many platforms from which presidents’ voices have resonated from, there hasn’t been any
                        one
                        more topical than that of Twitter. As we’ve learned, just from examining the tweets of two
                        powerful
                        leaders, their rhetoric and language speaks volumes about the kind of leader they were.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As social media
                        becomes inherently critical to presidential campaigns, a candidate's presence in the digital
                        space serves as a
                        valuable hint to voters about what kind of president they may eventually become. <label
