                        Barack Hussein Obama II and Donald John Trump were very different leaders of the same nation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Born of a white Kansas woman and black Kenyan man, Obama was raised in humble beginnings and
                        immersed in a ‘multiplicity’ of cultures, having lived in various countries from a very young
                        age. (Nelson, 2021) On the other hand, Trump, a son of a New York real estate developer, was
                        raised with rigour and diligence. He led an ambitious career that eventually led him to
                        tycoonify
                        his family’s business. (BBC, 2020)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both men have walked such divergent paths to the White House and in turn, America has followed
                        under two vastly different leadership methods. There continues to be debate on which of these
                        gentlemen has done a ‘better’ job at leading the world’s richest, and most powerful nation. Just
                        10 years ago, presidents would only have the chance to plead their case through well prepared
                        speeches broadcast on mainstream media, and even then, it would have been hard to know what they
                        were thinking.

                    <p>
                        But the advent of Twitter has somewhat levelled the playing field. It is one platform that has
                        redefined the volumes of American politics, enabling asynchronous conversations that give the
                        president and the people equal voice.

                            If such is the case, does the way in which Obama and Trump present themselves on Twitter

                            reflect their reputations respectively, as the Unifier and Divider?

                    <p>But unlike the presidents who preceded them, President Obama and Trump both used Twitter as a mouthpiece by which they could share their thoughts and conversations at all hours of the day.</p> -->

                    <p>Newspaper publications, radio broadcasts and television programmes were some of the ways that national messages were communicated over space and time.</p>
                    <p>In social media, powerful leaders, particularly in politics have found a new platform to keep the people up to date with their policies and at all hours of the day.</p>
                    <p>In his innovative use of social media, Obama earned the title of the first social media president, but during his time in office, Trump surely earned the title of the social media president.</p> -->

                    <p>Born of a white Kansas mother and black African American father, Obama became a symbol of unity when he entered office in 2008. It wasn't just his background, but also 
                        his policies and unifying approach to leading a diversifying nation that drove his identity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, Trump entered the race to the White House as an unpopular contender, largely for his divisive rhetoric wielded against the Hispanic and Muslim communities.
                        Carrying out unpopular policies such as 'Building the Wall' to keep illegal immigrants out and withdrawing from global climate agreements were thought to isolate the US from the world, and the people within it, from each toher.

                    <h3>On diversity</h3>

                    <p>
                        Exploring the demographic landscape of America over modern history, we can see just how much the
                        racial makeup
                        of the country has changed.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In what Frey (2018) calls a ‘diversity explosion’, the US has seen significant growth in
                        Hispanic, Asian and mixed ethnicity minorities, meaning a president who can bring these
                        differing groups together is more
                        important than ever before, for the future of the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s see how as president, Obama and Trump spoke
                        to empower their country on a united, or a divided front.

                    <!-- <h3>Diverse America</h3>
                    <p>The US is one of the most diverse nations in the world. If we map some of these key statistics
                        across the map of the US, we can catch a glimpse of just how diverse
                        the demographic make up of the nation is.

                        And to each of these groups of people, they will be driven by a problem that matters much more
                        than to others.
                    </p>
                    <p>The United States is one of the most diverse nations in the world - in gender, race, income, etc.
                        These are what make the US a very unique/powerful country, but at the same time, it is what is
                        causing present day challenges and rifts/social divides. </p> -->

                    <p>
                        In their bid to appeal to voters as presidential candidates, Obama and Trump diverged in their
                        approaches to
                        marketing their envisioned plan as leader, to the people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the campaign trail, both candidates participated in traditional campaign rallies to drive
                        engagement in states
                        across the nation. On top of this, both also utilised social media to a vast extent, as a means
                        of extending
                        their nationwide reach - an advantage that presidents who preceded them, simply did not have.
                    </p>
                    <!-- BIG NUMBERS? -->
                    <p>
                        Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign employed 100 people to help manage his digital presence
                        alone. As the first
                        presidential candidate to ‘go viral’, another factor that contributed to his success was the way
                        he shaped his
                        communications to be around his personality and family. As an incumbent four years later, Obama
                        continued to
                        engage with his audience, launching a Q&A on Twitter, and Reddit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kiss (2008) notes that “our subconscious is hard-wired to assume that faces we see regularly are
                        our own friends”.
                        With a consistent, friendly online presence coupled with constant televised appearances, Obama
                        quickly became a
                        popular figure who could bring together ‘all Americans’.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While Obama humanised his campaign, Trump ‘dehumanised’ through his social media presence. Trump
                        ‘boosted his reach’
                        as a wildcard candidate by leveraging controversial topics and adopting unpopular stances at the
                        expense of racial
                        minorities such as the Hispanic and Muslim communities.

                    <p>
                        By ‘sparking debate’ and generating anger, negativity and hate, Trump sought a leadership that
                        blamed a ‘shared’
                        common enemy, ‘foreign’ powers who were supposedly meddling in the great American dream and
                        future.

                    <p>Trump on the other hand is more adamant on making America great again, and he made enemies of

                    <h3>On political corrrectness</h3>
                    <p>After being inducted into the Oval office, both Obama and Trump continued to take vastly
                        different stances,
                        particularly on the hot button topic of political correctness.

                        The term political correctness began with an intention to avoid language that has been used
                        historically to
                        discriminate, belittle or offend minorities, in particular. (Mora, 2021) This kind of language
                        has grown to be
                        a hot button issue in the US, and both presidents have taken divergent stances on the topic.
                    </p>
                    <!-- in their tweets, Obama -->
                    <p>
                        On racial epithets and derogatory comments, Obama (2016) acknowledges that <q>“when you use
                            words like that,
                            you're reinforcing people feeling like they're outsiders, and less than other
                            Americans.”</q> (Obama, 2016).
                        If we look directly at his tweets, obama's use of common politically 'incorrect' terms (deemed
                        politically incorrect by XX),
                        is relatively low.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trump however, cites political correctness as an impediment to the First Amendment’s guarantee
                        of ‘freedom
                        of speech’, claiming time and time again that “I don’t frankly have time for total political
                        correctness,”
                        stating “I refuse to be politically correct.”
                        Amongst his tweets, over X % contained language that could be seen as offensive to certain
                        minority groups.

                        Over time, the tweets in which president Obama and Trump have made about minority groups

                        African Americans, Hispanics and Asians are ...

                    <!-- Carrying on from their initial presidential campaign, it’s interesting to observe how these both men 
                        have followed through with their method of leadership throughout their time in office.  -->

                    <!-- <p>Now lets take a step back and see how these leaders perform on a global scope.</p> -->
                    <p>If we have a look at how President Obama and President Trump talk about America, against the
                        world, it is no surprise that both appear to be inwardly focused.
                        Comparing the frequency by which either of them said the same word, Obama says words like
                        America and American much more than Trump while in office.
                        <!-- we want a bar graph here -->
                        <!-- ==  === -->
                    </p>
                    <!-- these were the countries that these tweets were associated with (choropleth map)-->
                    <!-- and these are where their policies were respectively included -->
                    <p>Now when we look at the individual tweets by President Obama, we can see how he spoke about other
                        nations. Although he mentioned more about the US, any words used to describe foreign nations
                        were
                        pleasant and kind.</p>
                    <!-- probably should resort to a bar chart -->
                    <!-- this should be a vector scatter plot with all of the tweets categorised into countries-->
                    <p>Comparing these with President Trump, we can see a significant shift in focus. All the words
                        thrown at foreign entities were on the side of hostile rather than kind.</p>
                    <!-- <p>
                            Even though his slogan throughout his political campaign was ‘Make America Great Again’, Trump seemed 
                            to be more interested in foreign than internal affairs. Most predominantly, he seemed to enjoy speaking 
                            about countries including X Y and Z. 
                            
                            Correspondingly, a sentiment analysis shows, that when talking about these nations, Trump seems to be 
                            putting them down/speaking negative things. 
                              
                            
                            However, on twitter, President Obama spoke more frequently about America and Americans than of his 
                            foreign counterparts.

                    <p>Political correctness begins with a belief in using inclusive language—words and phrases that
                        have not historically been used to demean, belittle, or insult any particular group of people.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although it is a term that has been around for centuries, Political Correctness has grown to be a
                        hot button topic. This is particularly true in the United States, arguably the most powerful
                        nation in the world which continues to grow both demographically and economically. </p>
                    <p>Political correctness has also been exacerbated, social media platforms like Twitter, have become
                        a breeding ground for criticisms and exchanged words against political correctness. </p>
                    <p>So the purpose of political correctness is to unite, rather than to divide.</p>

                        Of the many platforms from which presidents’ voices have resonated from, there hasn’t been any
                        one
                        more topical than that of Twitter. As we’ve learned, just from examining the tweets of two
                        powerful
                        leaders, their rhetoric and language speaks volumes about the kind of leader they were.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As social media
                        becomes inherently critical to presidential campaigns, a candidate's presence in the digital
                        space serves as a
                        valuable hint to voters about what kind of president they may eventually become.
