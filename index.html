                        Barack Hussein Obama II and Donald John Trump were very different leaders of the same nation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Born of a white Kansas woman and black Kenyan man, Obama was raised in humble beginnings and
                        immersed in a ‘multiplicity’ of cultures, having lived in various countries from a very young
                        age. (Nelson, 2021) On the other hand, Trump, a son of a New York real estate developer, was
                        raised with rigour. He built an ambitious career that eventually led him to
                        tycoonify
                        his family’s business. (BBC, 2020)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both presidents have walked such divergent paths to the White House and in turn, America has followed
                        under two vastly different leadership methods. There continues to be debate on which of these
                        leaders has done a ‘better’ job at leading the world’s richest, and most powerful nation. Just
                        10 years ago, presidents would only have the chance to plead their case through well prepared
                        speeches broadcast on mainstream media, and even then, it would have been hard to know what they
                        were thinking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the advent of Twitter has somewhat levelled the playing field. It is one platform that has
                        redefined the volumes of American politics, enabling asynchronous conversations that give the
                        president and the people equal voice.

                            If such is the case, does the way in which Obama and Trump present themselves on Twitter
                            accurately
                            reflect their reputations respectively, as the Unifier and Divider?

                    <p>In social media, powerful leaders, particularly in politics have found a new platform to keep the people up to date with their policies and at all hours of the day.</p>
                    <p>In his innovative use of social media, Obama earned the title of the first social media president, but during his time in office, Trump surely earned the title of the social media president.</p> -->

                    <p>Born of a white Kansas mother and black African American father, Obama became a symbol of unity when he entered office in 2008. It wasn't just his background, but also 
                        his policies and unifying approach to leading a diversifying nation that drove his identity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, Trump entered the race to the White House as an unpopular contender, largely for his divisive rhetoric wielded against the Hispanic and Muslim communities.
                        Carrying out unpopular policies such as 'Building the Wall' to keep illegal immigrants out and withdrawing from global climate agreements were thought to isolate the US from the world, and the people within it, from each toher.

                    <p>
                        Not all shows of leadership are identical. 
                        According to Razzetti (2018), one's approach to leadership demonstrates much about their priorities for the people.

                                A <strong>unifier</strong> aims to unite through a common cause,
                                by empowering people to achieve something "bigger than themselves in personally
                                meaningful and socially beneficial ways". (Razzetti, 2018)

                                approach is known to keep people on the same agenda in the short term, but eventually
                                creates disillusion and disempowers people.

                        These attitudes towards leadership have been defined historically, but continue to be as true today as ever. So why

                        We've all heard of Divide and Conquer - former President Trump's policies have been constantly

                        However, Obama's approach to leadership couldn't be any more different than Trump. With a Unite

                    <h3>On diversity</h3>

                    <p>
                        Exploring the demographic landscape of America since the turn of the 21st century, we can see just how much the
                        racial makeup of the country has changed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In what Frey (2018) calls a ‘diversity explosion’, the US has seen significant growth in
                        Hispanic, Asian and mixed ethnicity minorities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Observing transformations in ethnic origins amongst the American people from the past 17
                        years alone, shows that
                        all of the United States (some states albeit slower than others), have seen positive growth in
                        their <i>diversity index<label class="definition"><strong>Diversity Index:</strong> A measure of the racial/ethnic diversity of residents 
                            based on six major racial/ethnic groups (White, Black, Latino, Asian or Pacific Islander, Native American, and Mixed/other race). 
                            The maximum diversity score (1.79) would occur if each group were evenly represented in the region. (National Equity Atlas, 2021)</label></i>. 
                            <!-- The more densely populated, coastal states such as California and New York continue to record faster diversification than regional inland states. -->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The National Equity Atlas (2021) outlines that "diversity - in the context of inclusion - is a driver of 
                        innovation, business growth and economic progress."
                        
                        Thus a president who can bring these
                        differing groups together continues to be more important than ever before, to help cultivate a prosperous future for the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In light of such a diverse makeup just how did Obama and Trump appeal to the voters, if at all?
                        <!-- To appeal to an increasingly diverse nation, Obama and Trump adopted two different political stances.  -->
                        <!-- Let’s see how as president, Obama and Trump spoke
                        to empower their country on a united, or a divided front. -->
                    </p>
                    <!-- CHOROPLETH MAP THAT SHOWS OVER TIME THE change in the diversity index -->
                    <!-- CHOROPLETH MAP THAT SHOWS CHANGE IN NATIVITY + ANCESTRY (MORE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN BORN OVERSEAS, OR

                    <!-- <h3>Diverse America</h3>
                    <p>The US is one of the most diverse nations in the world. If we map some of these key statistics
                        across the map of the US, we can catch a glimpse of just how diverse
                        the demographic make up of the nation is.

                        And to each of these groups of people, they will be driven by a problem that matters much more
                        than to others.
                    </p>
                    <p>The United States is one of the most diverse nations in the world - in gender, race, income, etc.
                        These are what make the US a very unique/powerful country, but at the same time, it is what is
                        causing present day challenges and rifts/social divides. </p> -->

                        In addition to traditional, live political rallies, both Obama and Trump as presidents, also utilised social media as a means

                        Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign employed 100 people to help manage his digital presence

                        presidential candidate to ‘go viral’, another factor that contributed to his success was the way
                        he shaped his

                        continued to
                        engage with his audience, launching a Q&A on Twitter, and Reddit.

                        Kiss (2008) notes that “our subconscious is hard-wired to assume that faces we see regularly are
                        our own friends”.
                        With a consistent, friendly online presence coupled with constant televised appearances, Obama
                        quickly became a
                        popular figure who could bring together ‘all Americans’.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While Obama humanised his campaign, Trump ‘dehumanised’ through his social media presence. Trump
                        ‘boosted his reach’
                        as a wildcard candidate by leveraging controversial topics and adopting unpopular stances at the
                        expense of racial
                        minorities such as the Hispanic and Muslim communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By ‘sparking debate’ and generating anger, negativity and hate, Trump sought a leadership that
                        blamed a ‘shared’
                        common enemy, ‘foreign’ powers who were supposedly meddling in the great American dream and
                        future.
                    </p> -->
                    <p>Interestingly, Obama tweeted sparsely in his first presidential campaign. However, as an
                        incumbent in his campaign for re-election, Obama began to tweet in record amounts.</p>
                    <p>
                        At the very most, Obama tweeted 500 times in September of 2012, rallying online followers in his
                        bid for a second term. The majority of the tweets spoke of what he had already done, and what he
                        could do for the nation in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike Obama in his first election, Trump maintained a consistently high tweet rate in the lead up 
                        to voting season. Although he reassured the media, saying "Don’t worry, I’ll give it up after I’m president," he consistently tweeted upwards of 150 times a month throughout his first term. Seeking 
                        re-election, the number of tweets he made climbed to over 800 on a monthly basis. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although Twitter seemed to play a bigger role in Trump's first election campaign than in Obama's, the platform was undeniably pivotal
                        as they sought re-election.

                    <p>
                        Trump, having already been an active user on social media was freely spoken on Twitter. As a wildcard entry 
                        onto the presidential scene, Trump proclaimed “I don’t frankly have time for total political correctness,” 
                        reiterating, “I refuse to be politically correct.” 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In turn, his disregard for political correctness and divisive approach towards the internal challenges of America 
                        was made apparent in his pre-election promises:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trump promised to put Americans first through his keynote (although borrowed) slogan 'Make America Great Again'. 
                        Amongst the promises he had made through the rallies, he tweeted about
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, Obama acknowledges the importance of political correctness - not as a hot button topic to call 
                        out imperfect language, but to ensure discriminatory language is avoided in modern day speech.
                    </p>
                    <!-- <h3>On political corrrectness</h3>
                    <p>After being inducted into the Oval office, both Obama and Trump continued to take vastly
                        different stances,
                        particularly on the hot button topic of political correctness.

                        The term political correctness began with an intention to avoid language that has been used
                        historically to
                        discriminate, belittle or offend minorities, in particular. (Mora, 2021) This kind of language
                        has grown to be
                        a hot button issue in the US, and both presidents have taken divergent stances on the topic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On racial epithets and derogatory comments, Obama (2016) acknowledges that <q>“when you use
                            words like that,
                            you're reinforcing people feeling like they're outsiders, and less than other
                            Americans.”</q> (Obama, 2016).
                        If we look directly at his tweets, obama's use of common politically 'incorrect' terms (deemed
                        politically incorrect by XX),
                        is relatively low.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trump however, cites political correctness as an impediment to the First Amendment’s guarantee
                        of ‘freedom
                        of speech’, claiming time and time again that “I don’t frankly have time for total political
                        correctness,”
                        stating “I refuse to be politically correct.”
                        Amongst his tweets, over X % contained language that could be seen as offensive to certain
                        minority groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time, the tweets in which president Obama and Trump have made about minority groups

                        African Americans, Hispanics and Asians are ...

                    <h4>How do the presidents talk about and treat foreign powers?</h4>
                    <!-- Carrying on from their initial presidential campaign, it’s interesting to observe how these both men 
                        have followed through with their method of leadership throughout their time in office.  -->

                    <!-- <p>Now lets take a step back and see how these leaders perform on a global scope.</p> -->
                    <p>As presidents of the US, one might assume that both Obama and Trump are focused on discussing and raising problems
                        that have to do with internal policies.</p>
                    <p>The data tells us otherwise, however.</p>
                    <!-- <p>As presidents of the US, it's an assumption that Obama and Trump seemingly spoke on the topic of America against the
                        world, so it is no surprise that both appear to be inwardly focused.
                        Comparing the frequency by which either of them said the same word, Obama says words like
                        America and American much more than Trump while in office.

                    </p> -->
                    
                        <!-- we want a bar graph here -->
                        <!-- ==  === -->
                    <p>Interestingly, President Obama tweeted about the US more than twice as frequently as Trump.</p>
                    <div id="america-mentioned-bar" class="plots"></div>
                    <!-- <p>Looking at the tweets specifically, </p> -->

                    <!-- and these are where their policies were respectively included -->
                    <!-- <p>In fact, looking at the individual tweets by President Obama, we can see how he spoke about other
                        nations. Although he mentioned the US, any words used to describe foreign nations
                        were pleasant and kind.</p> -->

                    <!-- <p>Comparing these with President Trump, we can see a significant shift in focus. All the words
                        thrown at foreign entities were on the side of hostile rather than kind.</p> -->

                    <p>Mapping out the countries mentioned in their tweets, it continues to show that Trump had a greater international focus as opposed to Obama.</p>
                        <div id="countries-mentioned-map" class="plots"></div>
                        <p>
                            Obama tweeted about American topics over 10 times as much as he acknowledged his foreign counterparts. 
                            However, Trump tweeted near equal amounts about both American and international topics. He also made 200 tweets more regarding foreign affairs than internal affairs.
                        </p>
                        <!-- But amongst the tweets of foreign nations, Obama adopted a positive outlook ... -->
                        <!-- The sentiment of most of these tweets expressed a positive outlook,  -->
                        <p>From a glance, Trump already appears to have strayed from the internal challenges of his country, while Obama stayed true to his own nation.</p>
                        
                        <p>A deep dive into the tweets, categorised by country and sentiment, reveals even more about their perspectives on America against the World.</p>
                        <h1>CHART HERE WITH TWEET CLUSTERS ON FOREIGN AND INTERNAL TOPICS</h1>
                        <p>President Obama's tweets on foreign nations appear to consist of mostly 'necessary' comments, such as
                            "Welcoming Prime Minister Singh of India for the first state visit of this administration." and
                            "The American people send their deepest condolences to the Chilean people. The U.S. is ready to help in any way." which seem to be diplomatically necessitated exchanges.</p>
                        <p>It could be said that President Obama truly adopted a 'unifier' mindset, speaking on behalf of the people, for the benefit of the nation.</p>
                            <!-- <p>As president, Trump was known for tweeting </p> -->
                            <!-- <p>Although some of the comments made were politically motivated, especially from President Trump who attempted to defend a non-collusive relationship with the Russian government,
                            Trump also made personal attacks on nations, most of which lack any factual backing. 
                        </p> -->
                        <p>Completely polar to his predecessor, President Trump demonstrated a 'divider' attitude making personal attacks on foreign nations, not necessarily in the interest of the people as a whole, and thus 
                            was self-serving.

                        <!-- <p>Just from their comments on Twitter alone, Obama clearly lives up to his title of a 'unifier', retaining an internal focus through nearly all of the topics 
                            he opted to address. Inversely, President Trump engaged more frequently in foreign influence and interference
                            than internal challenges, making his divisive approach to leadership apparent.
                        </p> -->
                    <!-- <p>
                            Even though his slogan throughout his political campaign was ‘Make America Great Again’, Trump seemed 
                            to be more interested in foreign than internal affairs. Most predominantly, he seemed to enjoy speaking 
                            about countries including X Y and Z. 
                            
                            Correspondingly, a sentiment analysis shows, that when talking about these nations, Trump seems to be 
                            putting them down/speaking negative things. 
                              
                            
                            However, on twitter, President Obama spoke more frequently about America and Americans than of his 
                            foreign counterparts.

                        Of the many platforms from which presidents’ voices have resonated from, there hasn’t been any
                        one
                        more topical than that of Twitter. As we’ve learned, just from examining the tweets of two
                        powerful
                        leaders, their rhetoric and language speaks volumes about the kind of leader they were.

                        As social media
                        becomes inherently critical to presidential campaigns, a candidate's presence in the digital
                        space serves as a
                        valuable hint to voters about what kind of president they may eventually become.
