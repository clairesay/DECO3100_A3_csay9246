                    <p>
                        Barack Hussein Obama II and Donald John Trump were very different leaders of the same nation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Born of a white Kansas woman and black Kenyan man, Obama was raised in humble beginnings and
                        immersed in a ‘multiplicity’ of cultures, having lived in various countries from a very young
                        age. (Nelson, 2021)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, Trump, a son of a New York real estate developer, was
                        raised with rigour. He built an ambitious career that eventually led him to
                        tycoonify
                        his family’s business. (BBC, 2020)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both presidents have walked such divergent paths to the White House and in turn, America has followed
                        under two vastly different leadership methods. 
                        
                        There continues to be debate on which of these
                        leaders has done a ‘better’ job at leading the world’s richest, and most powerful nation. Just
                        10 years ago, presidents would only have the chance to plead their case through well prepared
                        speeches broadcast on mainstream media, and even then, it would have been hard to know what they
                        were thinking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the advent of Twitter has somewhat levelled the playing field. It is one platform that has
                        redefined the volumes of American politics, enabling asynchronous conversations that give the
                        president and the people equal voice.

                        <strong>
                            If such is the case, does the way in which Obama and Trump present themselves on Twitter
                            accurately reflect their reputations respectively, as the Unifier and Divider?

                    <p>But unlike the presidents who preceded them, President Obama and Trump both used Twitter as a mouthpiece by which they could share their thoughts and conversations at all hours of the day.</p> -->

                    <p>In his innovative use of social media, Obama earned the title of the first social media president, but during his time in office, Trump surely earned the title of the social media president.</p> -->

                    <!-- <p>Despite their similarities in using social media, both could not be any more different.</p>
                    <p>Born of a white Kansas mother and black African American father, Obama became a symbol of unity when he entered office in 2008. It wasn't just his background, but also 
                        his policies and unifying approach to leading a diversifying nation that drove his identity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, Trump entered the race to the White House as an unpopular contender, largely for his divisive rhetoric wielded against the Hispanic and Muslim communities.
                        Carrying out unpopular policies such as 'Building the Wall' to keep illegal immigrants out and withdrawing from global climate agreements were thought to isolate the US from the world, and the people within it, from each toher.

                    <!-- <p>How does Twitter come into this? Obama and Trump were the first presidents to utilise social media not only to communicate ongoing policies, but also to comment on happening events.</p>

                    <p>
                        Exploring the demographic landscape of America since the turn of the 21st century, we can see just how much the
                        racial makeup of the country has changed.

                    <p>
                        In what Frey (2018) calls a ‘diversity explosion’, the US has seen significant growth in
                        Hispanic, Asian and mixed ethnicity minorities.

                        This is largely due to "youthful immigration from Latin America, and Asia" which has been crucial to a shift in the ethnic landscape. Lee (2020)

                        <!-- Immigration from Latin America and Asia is a key driver of this trend, in part because the newly arrived immigrant groups tend to have youthful age structures and higher fertility. Intermarriage (and the resulting multiracial offspring) and shifts in racial-ethnic identity also play significant roles in boosting diversity. -->

                        Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign employed 100 people to help manage his digital presence
                        alone. As the first
                        presidential candidate to ‘go viral’, another factor that contributed to his success was the way
                        he shaped his
                        communications to be around his personality and family. As an incumbent four years later, Obama
                        continued to
                        engage with his audience, launching a Q&A on Twitter, and Reddit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kiss (2008) notes that “our subconscious is hard-wired to assume that faces we see regularly are
                        our own friends”.
                        With a consistent, friendly online presence coupled with constant televised appearances, Obama
                        quickly became a
                        popular figure who could bring together ‘all Americans’.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While Obama humanised his campaign, Trump ‘dehumanised’ through his social media presence. Trump
                        ‘boosted his reach’
                        as a wildcard candidate by leveraging controversial topics and adopting unpopular stances at the
                        expense of racial
                        minorities such as the Hispanic and Muslim communities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By ‘sparking debate’ and generating anger, negativity and hate, Trump sought a leadership that
                        blamed a ‘shared’
                        common enemy, ‘foreign’ powers who were supposedly meddling in the great American dream and

                    <!-- Obama's voter population was somewhat more diverse. Although white people made up the majority of the voter population, there was a record turnout amongst people of colour. -->
                    <!-- Following the  -->

                    he first-person singular (“I will make this country great again”) is authoritative and agenda-setting, whereas
                     the first-person plural (“We will make this country great again”) acts more as a collective call-to-arms. The
                      second person (“You will make this country great again”) works as an imperative that imbues the listener with a 
                      feeling of power, but the third-person plural (“They will make this country great again”) takes that same power
                       away and gives it to an unseen entity.

                    <p>Throughout their presidencies, the use of pronouns were used to elicit the message they wished to express. 
                        In fact, the way a president aligns with their people starts with their choice of language. 
                        <!-- This reduced form of language plays a pivotal role in 
                        constructing the rhetoric the speaker wishes to convey to their audience.  -->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bramley (2001) finds that politicians leverage pronouns such as "I, you we or they" to either "show affiliation or 
                        create distance".
                        <!-- , pending the topic they are speaking of.  -->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First person pronouns position the context of the topic from the speaker's point of view. The use of 'I' suggests that one is expressing 
                        their "own standing as an individual", and often suggests no external influence. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an inclusive sense, the use of 'we' implies
                        "collective identity" and shared responsibilities, and in a similar manner, 'you' brings the listener into the speaker's context, implying
                        a lot of 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps most divisively, terms like 'they' place the greatest distance between oneself and the party being mentioned.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Obama and Trump's use of pronouns offer a hint to their priorities between themselves as a person, to their stance as a
                        leader of the nation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Approximately 1 in 10 tweets by Trump contained personal pronouns including the words 'I, my, me and mine'.

                        But only 3% of tweets by Obama were of his perspective. Interestingly, Obama tended to convey personal quotes 
                        by referencing himself as 'Obama', although this may have been the work of his digital communications team.

                        Trump, having already been an active user on social media was freely spoken on Twitter. As a wildcard entry 
                        onto the presidential scene, Trump proclaimed “I don’t frankly have time for total political correctness,” 
                        reiterating, “I refuse to be politically correct.” 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In turn, his disregard for political correctness and divisive approach towards the internal challenges of America 
                        was made apparent in his pre-election promises:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trump promised to put Americans first through his keynote (although borrowed) slogan 'Make America Great Again'. 
                        Amongst the promises he had made through the rallies, he tweeted about
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, Obama acknowledges the importance of political correctness - not as a hot button topic to call 
                        out imperfect language, but to ensure discriminatory language is avoided in modern day speech.
                    </p> -->
                    <!-- <h3>On political corrrectness</h3>
                    <p>After being inducted into the Oval office, both Obama and Trump continued to take vastly
                        different stances,
                        particularly on the hot button topic of political correctness.

                        The term political correctness began with an intention to avoid language that has been used
                        historically to
                        discriminate, belittle or offend minorities, in particular. (Mora, 2021) This kind of language
                        has grown to be
                        a hot button issue in the US, and both presidents have taken divergent stances on the topic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On racial epithets and derogatory comments, Obama (2016) acknowledges that <q>“when you use
                            words like that,
                            you're reinforcing people feeling like they're outsiders, and less than other
                            Americans.”</q> (Obama, 2016).
                        If we look directly at his tweets, obama's use of common politically 'incorrect' terms (deemed
                        politically incorrect by XX),
                        is relatively low.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trump however, cites political correctness as an impediment to the First Amendment’s guarantee
                        of ‘freedom
                        of speech’, claiming time and time again that “I don’t frankly have time for total political
                        correctness,”
                        stating “I refuse to be politically correct.”
                        Amongst his tweets, over X % contained language that could be seen as offensive to certain
                        minority groups.

                    <p>As presidents of the US, one might assume that both Obama and Trump are focused on discussing and raising problems
                        that have to do with internal policies.
                    </br></br>
                    The data tells us otherwise, however.

                    <!-- <p>As presidents of the US, it's an assumption that Obama and Trump seemingly spoke on the topic of America against the
                        world, so it is no surprise that both appear to be inwardly focused.
                        Comparing the frequency by which either of them said the same word, Obama says words like
                        America and American much more than Trump while in office.

                    <!-- <p>In fact, looking at the individual tweets by President Obama, we can see how he spoke about other
                        nations. Although he mentioned the US, any words used to describe foreign nations
                        were pleasant and kind.</p> -->

                        thrown at foreign entities were on the side of hostile rather than kind.</p> -->

                    <p>Mapping out the countries mentioned in their tweets, it continues to show that Trump had a greater international focus as opposed to Obama.</p>

                            Obama tweeted about American topics over 10 times as much as he acknowledged his foreign counterparts. 
                            However, Trump tweeted near equal amounts about both American and international topics. He also made 200 tweets more regarding foreign affairs than internal affairs.

                        <p>From a glance, Trump already appears to have strayed from the internal challenges of his country, while Obama stayed true to his own nation.</p>

                        <p>President Obama's tweets on foreign nations appear to consist of mostly 'necessary' comments, such as
                            "Welcoming Prime Minister Singh of India for the first state visit of this administration." and
                            "The American people send their deepest condolences to the Chilean people. The U.S. is ready to help in any way." which seem to be diplomatically necessitated exchanges.</p>
                        <p>It could be said that President Obama truly adopted a 'unifier' mindset, speaking on behalf of the people, for the benefit of the nation.</p>

                            <!-- <p>Although some of the comments made were politically motivated, especially from President Trump who attempted to defend a non-collusive relationship with the Russian government,
                            Trump also made personal attacks on nations, most of which lack any factual backing. 
                        </p> -->
                        <p>Completely polar to his predecessor, President Trump demonstrated a 'divider' attitude making personal attacks on foreign nations, not necessarily in the interest of the people as a whole, and thus 
                            was self-serving.

                        <!-- <p>Just from their comments on Twitter alone, Obama clearly lives up to his title of a 'unifier', retaining an internal focus through nearly all of the topics 
                            he opted to address. Inversely, President Trump engaged more frequently in foreign influence and interference
                            than internal challenges, making his divisive approach to leadership apparent.
                        </p> -->
                    <!-- <p>
                            Even though his slogan throughout his political campaign was ‘Make America Great Again’, Trump seemed 
                            to be more interested in foreign than internal affairs. Most predominantly, he seemed to enjoy speaking 
                            about countries including X Y and Z. 
                            
                            Correspondingly, a sentiment analysis shows, that when talking about these nations, Trump seems to be 
                            putting them down/speaking negative things. 
                              
                            
                            However, on twitter, President Obama spoke more frequently about America and Americans than of his 
                            foreign counterparts.

                    <p>Political correctness begins with a belief in using inclusive language—words and phrases that
                        have not historically been used to demean, belittle, or insult any particular group of people.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although it is a term that has been around for centuries, Political Correctness has grown to be a
                        hot button topic. This is particularly true in the United States, arguably the most powerful
                        nation in the world which continues to grow both demographically and economically. </p>
                    <p>Political correctness has also been exacerbated, social media platforms like Twitter, have become
                        a breeding ground for criticisms and exchanged words against political correctness. </p>
                    <p>So the purpose of political correctness is to unite, rather than to divide.</p>

                        Of the many platforms from which presidents’ voices have resonated from, there hasn’t been any
                        one
                        more topical than that of Twitter. As we’ve learned, just from examining the tweets of two
                        powerful
                        leaders, their rhetoric and language speaks volumes about the kind of leader they were.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As social media
                        becomes inherently critical to presidential campaigns, a candidate's presence in the digital
                        space serves as a
                        valuable hint to voters about what kind of president they may eventually become.
