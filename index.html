                    <p>
                        Barack Hussein Obama II and Donald John Trump were very different leaders of the same nation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Born of a white Kansas woman and black Kenyan man, Obama was raised in humble beginnings and
                        immersed in a ‘multiplicity’ of cultures, having lived in various countries from a very young
                        age. (Nelson, 2021)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, Trump, a son of a New York real estate developer, was
                        raised with rigour. He built an ambitious career that eventually led him to
                        tycoonify his family’s business. (BBC, 2020)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite having walked such divergent paths to the White House, and led their nation in distinct
                        ways, they share the title of 'Social Media president' due in large part to, their presence on Twitter.

                        <!-- Both presidents have walked such divergent paths to the White House and in turn, America has followed
                        under two vastly different leadership methods. However,  -->
                        
                        <!-- The advent of Twitter is just platform that has somewhat levelled the playing field.  -->


                        <!-- There continues to be debate on which of these
                        leaders has done a ‘better’ job at leading the world’s richest, and most powerful nation. Just
                        10 years ago, presidents would only have the chance to plead their case through well prepared
                        speeches broadcast on mainstream media, and even then, it would have been hard to know what they
                        were thinking.
                    </p>
                    <p> -->
                        <!-- But the advent of Twitter has somewhat levelled the playing field. It is one platform that has
                        redefined the volumes of American politics, enabling asynchronous conversations that give the
                        president and the people equal voice. -->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, Twitter has helped redefine the volumes of American politics, with both presidents using it as mouthpiece
                        to engage with the greater American public. 
                    </p>

                        <strong>
                            If such is the case, does the way in which Obama and Trump present themselves on Twitter
                            accurately reflect their reputations respectively, as the Unifier and Divider?
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <!-- <p>Obama and trump are very different leaders of the same nation.</p>
                    <p>Obama has long been said to be a unifier of the American people, while Trump became the infamous divisive president.</p>
                    <p>But unlike the presidents who preceded them, President Obama and Trump both used Twitter as a mouthpiece by which they could share their thoughts and conversations at all hours of the day.</p> -->
                    <!-- <p>Throughout history, the mediums by which American presidents addressed their nation continued to change over time.</p>
                    <p>Newspaper publications, radio broadcasts and television programmes were some of the ways that national messages were communicated over space and time.</p>
                    <p>In social media, powerful leaders, particularly in politics have found a new platform to keep the people up to date with their policies and at all hours of the day.</p>
                    <p>In his innovative use of social media, Obama earned the title of the first social media president, but during his time in office, Trump surely earned the title of the social media president.</p> -->
                    <!-- WHAT DID TRUMP TWEET VS WHAT DID OBAMA TWEET -->
                    <!-- <p>Despite their similarities in using social media, both could not be any more different.</p>
                    <p>Born of a white Kansas mother and black African American father, Obama became a symbol of unity when he entered office in 2008. It wasn't just his background, but also 
                        his policies and unifying approach to leading a diversifying nation that drove his identity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, Trump entered the race to the White House as an unpopular contender, largely for his divisive rhetoric wielded against the Hispanic and Muslim communities.
                        Carrying out unpopular policies such as 'Building the Wall' to keep illegal immigrants out and withdrawing from global climate agreements were thought to isolate the US from the world, and the people within it, from each toher. 
                    </p> -->

                    <!-- <p>How does Twitter come into this? Obama and Trump were the first presidents to utilise social media not only to communicate ongoing policies, but also to comment on happening events.</p>
                    <p>It is a mouthpiece by which people have been able to communicate their thoughts about current events within 140 characters or less.</p> -->
                    <!-- preceded by the likes of President Kennedy (the TV president) and President Roosevelt (frequently broadcasted via radio).</p> -->
                    <!-- <p>With the advent of social media, presidents have also been able to access social media. </p> -->
                    <!-- the American public accessed the messages shared by their chief of state.</p> -->
                    <!-- <p>It is also through these messages that the people learn who their president is - are they down to earth, do they take national security seriously, what is their stance on hot button issues and perhaps, if they like mustard on their hot dogs?</p> -->
                    <!-- <p>This visualisation seeks to explore how their language, with a focus on their social media
                        activity on Twitter, can be an indication of what kind of leader they are.</p> -->

                    <!-- <p>In their book, a 'Better way to evaluate leadership potential', Cohn and Wiley identify seven key qualities, which research time and time again have demonstrated what makes a good leader.</p> -->

                    <p>
                        Not all shows of leadership are identical. 
                        According to Razzetti (2018), one's approach to leadership demonstrates much about their priorities for the people.

                                <mark class="republican">Trump</mark> was unpopular for his divisive approach to leadership, blaming foreign influence to bond Americans together in the short term. 
                                However, he was remembered for the way he disillusioned and disempowered people. (Smith, 2020)

                        These attitudes towards leadership have been defined historically, but continue to be as true today as ever. So why
                        would a leadership stance be so important for a powerhouse nation as the US?

                        compared to such a method.
                        However, Obama's approach to leadership couldn't be any more different than Trump. With a Unite

                        In what Frey (2018) calls a ‘diversity explosion’, the US has seen significant growth in mixed ethnicity minorities
                         due to "youthful immigration from Latin America, and Asia" which has been crucial to a shift in the ethnic landscape. (Lee, 2020)

                        <!-- Immigration from Latin America and Asia is a key driver of this trend, in part because the newly arrived immigrant groups tend to have youthful age structures and higher fertility. Intermarriage (and the resulting multiracial offspring) and shifts in racial-ethnic identity also play significant roles in boosting diversity. -->

                        The National Equity Atlas (2021) outlines that "diversity - in the context of inclusion - is a driver of 
                        innovation, business growth and economic progress."
                    </p>

                        Thus a president who can bring these
                        differing groups together continues to be more important than ever before, to help cultivate a prosperous future for the country.

                        In light of such a diverse makeup how did Obama and Trump communicate to appeal to voters, if at all?

                        Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign employed 100 people to help manage his digital presence
                        alone. As the first
                        presidential candidate to ‘go viral’, another factor that contributed to his success was the way
                        he shaped his
                        communications to be around his personality and family. As an incumbent four years later, Obama
                        continued to
                        engage with his audience, launching a Q&A on Twitter, and Reddit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kiss (2008) notes that “our subconscious is hard-wired to assume that faces we see regularly are
                        our own friends”.
                        With a consistent, friendly online presence coupled with constant televised appearances, Obama
                        quickly became a
                        popular figure who could bring together ‘all Americans’.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While Obama humanised his campaign, Trump ‘dehumanised’ through his social media presence. Trump
                        ‘boosted his reach’
                        as a wildcard candidate by leveraging controversial topics and adopting unpopular stances at the
                        expense of racial
                        minorities such as the Hispanic and Muslim communities.

                    <p>
                        By ‘sparking debate’ and generating anger, negativity and hate, Trump sought a leadership that
                        blamed a ‘shared’
                        common enemy, ‘foreign’ powers who were supposedly meddling in the great American dream and
                        future.

                        Obama tweeted sparsely throughout his presidency, when compared to the leadup to his re-election, as an incumbent.

                    <p>
                        At the very most, Obama tweeted just shy of 500 times in September 2012, rallying online followers in his
                        bid for a second term.

                        Trump, having already been an active user on social media was freely spoken on Twitter. As a wildcard entry 
                        onto the presidential scene, Trump proclaimed “I don’t frankly have time for total political correctness,” 
                        reiterating, “I refuse to be politically correct.” 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In turn, his disregard for political correctness and divisive approach towards the internal challenges of America 
                        was made apparent in his pre-election promises:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trump promised to put Americans first through his keynote (although borrowed) slogan 'Make America Great Again'. 
                        Amongst the promises he had made through the rallies, he tweeted about
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, Obama acknowledges the importance of political correctness - not as a hot button topic to call 
                        out imperfect language, but to ensure discriminatory language is avoided in modern day speech.
                    </p> -->
                    <!-- <h3>On political corrrectness</h3>
                    <p>After being inducted into the Oval office, both Obama and Trump continued to take vastly
                        different stances,
                        particularly on the hot button topic of political correctness.

                        The term political correctness began with an intention to avoid language that has been used
                        historically to
                        discriminate, belittle or offend minorities, in particular. (Mora, 2021) This kind of language
                        has grown to be
                        a hot button issue in the US, and both presidents have taken divergent stances on the topic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On racial epithets and derogatory comments, Obama (2016) acknowledges that <q>“when you use
                            words like that,
                            you're reinforcing people feeling like they're outsiders, and less than other
                            Americans.”</q> (Obama, 2016).
                        If we look directly at his tweets, obama's use of common politically 'incorrect' terms (deemed
                        politically incorrect by XX),
                        is relatively low.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trump however, cites political correctness as an impediment to the First Amendment’s guarantee
                        of ‘freedom
                        of speech’, claiming time and time again that “I don’t frankly have time for total political
                        correctness,”
                        stating “I refuse to be politically correct.”
                        Amongst his tweets, over X % contained language that could be seen as offensive to certain
                        minority groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time, the tweets in which president Obama and Trump have made about minority groups
                        including Women,
                        African Americans, Hispanics and Asians are ...

                    <p>
                        This is in comparison with President Trump whose most used pronouns were 'third person' terms like 'they' and 'them', 
                        which place the greatest distance between a speaker and the party in question. (Bramley, 2001)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trump tweeted with a personal perspective, almost as much as he used collective pronouns in his language.

                    <p>As presidents of the US, one might assume that both Obama and Trump are focused on discussing and raising problems
                        that have to do with internal policies.

                    The data tells us otherwise, however.

                    <!-- <p>As presidents of the US, it's an assumption that Obama and Trump seemingly spoke on the topic of America against the
                        world, so it is no surprise that both appear to be inwardly focused.
                        Comparing the frequency by which either of them said the same word, Obama says words like
                        America and American much more than Trump while in office.

                    <!-- <p>In fact, looking at the individual tweets by President Obama, we can see how he spoke about other
                        nations. Although he mentioned the US, any words used to describe foreign nations
                        were pleasant and kind.</p> -->

                        <p>
                            In fact, Obama tweeted about American topics over 10 times as much as he acknowledged his foreign counterparts. 
                            However, Trump posted 200 tweets more about international topics than internal affairs.
                            <!-- However, Trump tweeted near equal amounts about both American and international topics.  -->
                            <!-- He also made 200 tweets more regarding foreign affairs than internal affairs. -->
                        </p>
                        <!-- But amongst the tweets of foreign nations, Obama adopted a positive outlook ... -->
                        <!-- The sentiment of most of these tweets expressed a positive outlook,  -->
                        <p>From a glance, Trump already appears to have strayed from the internal challenges of his country, while Obama stayed true to his own nation.</p>
                        
                    <p>Mapping out the countries mentioned in their tweets, it shows just how widespread Trump's international perspective was, as opposed to Obama.</p>

                        Unifier and Divider in the political correctness debate.</p>

                        Of the many platforms from which presidents’ voices have resonated from, there hasn’t been any
                        one
                        more topical than that of Twitter. As we’ve learned, just from examining the tweets of two
                        powerful
                        leaders, their rhetoric and language speaks volumes about the kind of leader they were.

                        As social media
                        becomes inherently critical to presidential campaigns, a candidate's presence in the digital
                        space serves as a
                        valuable hint to voters about what kind of president they may eventually become.
